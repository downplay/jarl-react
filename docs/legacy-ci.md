# Legacy CI/CD: CircleCI + Now (Zeit) — archived reference

This document captures what the pre-v2 CircleCI pipeline and Now (Zeit) deployment
were doing, at the point they were removed in favour of GitHub Actions
(ticket 60 on the TODOS board). It exists so the new GitHub Actions workflow
(`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) can be checked against it and nothing that mattered
gets silently dropped. The original source files were `.circleci/config.yml` and
`now/now.json` (both deleted by this change) — see git history on `master` prior
to this commit if the raw files are needed again.

## Runtime environment

- Docker image: `cypress/base:8` (Node 8, with Cypress system deps preinstalled).
- Package manager: `yarn` (`yarn.lock` present; `package-lock.json` also present but
  yarn was the CI-driven tool via `yarn bootstrap`/lerna).
- Monorepo managed with **Lerna**; most "run across packages" steps are
  `lerna run <script> --stream`.

## Caching

- CircleCI `restore_cache`/`save_cache` keyed on
  `v5-dependencies-{{ checksum "package.json" }}-{{ checksum "demo/package.json" }}-{{ checksum "packages/jarl-react/package.json" }}-{{ checksum "packages/jarl-react-native/package.json" }}-{{ checksum "packages/jarl-react-redux/package.json" }}`,
  falling back to the latest `v5-dependencies-` cache on miss.
- Cached paths: `node_modules`, `demo/node_modules`,
  `packages/jarl-react/node_modules`, `packages/jarl-react-native/node_modules`,
  `packages/jarl-react-redux/node_modules`.
- There was a commented-out, never-reactivated attempt at Docker layer caching for
  the demo-site image (`v4-dockerlayer-...`) — dead code, not carried forward.

## Workflows (CircleCI `workflows:` block)

Two workflows, both built from the single `build` job (and `publish` only on the
second):

1. **`pr_build`** — runs the `build` job on every branch *except* `master`
   (i.e. PR/branch validation).
2. **`master_deploy`** — runs `build` then `publish` (requires `build`) only on
   `master` (i.e. deploy pipeline after merge).

## `build` job — CI validation duties

Steps, in order:

1. `checkout`
2. Restore dependency cache (see above).
3. **Setup**: `touch env` (placeholder env file), `yarn`, `yarn bootstrap`
   (lerna bootstrap — links workspace packages together).
4. **Tag detection**: `git describe`, and if it matches `vX.Y.Z` (with optional
   `-prerelease.N` suffix), export `JARL_VERSION` for later steps.
5. Discord notify: `yarn notify build` (posts PR number / version / generic
   "building for staging" message to a Discord webhook, using
   `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_ID`/`DISCORD_WEBHOOK_TOKEN` secrets — see `scripts/notify.js`).
6. Save dependency cache (see above).
7. **Lint**: `yarn lint` (→ `lerna run lint --stream`, ESLint across packages,
   `--max-warnings 0` per-package).
8. **Build**: `yarn build` (→ `node ./scripts/build.js`), with
   `JARL_BUILD_NUMBER=${CIRCLE_BUILD_NUM}` exported first. Builds all packages
   and the demo site.
9. **Unit tests**: `yarn ci-test` (→ `lerna run ci-test --stream`, which in each
   package (`jarl-react`, `jarl-react-native`, `jarl-react-redux`) runs
   `jest --colors`).
10. **E2E — start server**: in `demo/`, `yarn ci-start` (→
    `babel-node ./server/production.js`) run **in the background**.
11. **E2E — run Cypress**: in `demo/`, `yarn ci-cypress` (→
    `cypress run --record --key ${CYPRESS_DASHBOARD} --env JARL_VERSION=...,CIRCLE_BUILD_NUM=...`
    — records to the Cypress Dashboard using the `CYPRESS_DASHBOARD` secret).
12. **E2E — stop server**: in `demo/`, `yarn ci-stop` (→ `pkill -SIGINT JARLDEMO`).
13. Persist build artifacts to the CircleCI workspace for the `publish` job:
    `demo/dist`, `demo/cypress/screenshots`, and the compiled `*.js` output of
    all three packages (CJS + `es/` builds).

## `publish` job — deploy duties (master only, after `build`)

Steps, in order:

1. `checkout`, restore cache, setup (`yarn` + `yarn bootstrap`), re-detect
   `JARL_VERSION` tag, attach the workspace artifacts from `build`.
2. Write an npm auth token file (`~/.npmrc`) from the `NPM_TOKEN` secret.
3. **Publish to npm, only if tagged** (`JARL_VERSION` set): `npm publish` in
   each of `packages/jarl-react`, `packages/jarl-react-native`,
   `packages/jarl-react-redux` (run manually per-package rather than via
   `lerna publish`, because lerna wasn't picking up the auth file), then
   Discord-notify `published`.
4. **Docker**: `setup_remote_docker`, manually install a pinned Docker CLI
   (`17.03.0-ce`) since the Cypress base image didn't have one, then
   `docker build -t app demo` (uses `demo/Dockerfile`, not present in this
   repo checkout — likely lived only inside `demo/`).
5. **Tag and push the Docker image**: `docker login` with
   `DOCKER_USER`/`DOCKER_PASS` secrets, tag as
   `downplay/jarl-demos:${JARL_VERSION}` if tagged, else
   `downplay/jarl-demos:${CIRCLE_SHA1}`, push to Docker Hub, and append a
   `FROM <tag>` line to `now/Dockerfile` (built at CI time, not committed).
6. **Deploy to Now (Zeit) staging**: `yarn global add now`, then from `now/`
   run `now -t ${NOW_TOKEN}` against `now/now.json`
   (`{ "name": "jarl-downplay-co" }`, i.e. deploying the just-built Docker
   image under that Now project name), scrape the resulting deploy URL out of
   `now`'s CLI output, export it as `NOW_DEPLOY`, Discord-notify `staging`
   (posts the staging URL plus a Cypress homepage screenshot).
7. **E2E against staging**: in `demo/`, `yarn ci-cypress` again, this time
   with `CYPRESS_baseUrl=${NOW_DEPLOY}` — smoke-tests the actual deployed
   staging instance rather than the local server.
8. **Alias to production, only if tagged**: `now -t ${NOW_TOKEN} alias
   ${NOW_DEPLOY} jarl.downplay.co` — promotes the staging deploy to the
   production alias, then Discord-notifies `deployed`.

## Secrets/env vars referenced (CircleCI project settings, not in-repo)

- `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_ID`, `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_TOKEN` — build/deploy notifications
  to Discord (`scripts/notify.js`).
- `CYPRESS_DASHBOARD` — Cypress Dashboard recording key.
- `NPM_TOKEN` — publish packages to the npm registry.
- `DOCKER_USER`, `DOCKER_PASS` — Docker Hub credentials.
- `NOW_TOKEN` — Now (Zeit) deploy token.
- CircleCI-provided: `CIRCLE_BUILD_NUM`, `CIRCLE_BUILD_URL`, `CIRCLE_SHA1`,
  `CIRCLE_COMMIT`, `CIRCLE_PULL_REQUEST`.

## Environments

- **PR/branch builds** (`pr_build` workflow): build + lint + unit test + local
  E2E only, no deploy.
- **`master` builds** (`master_deploy` workflow): everything above, plus
  Docker image build/push, deploy to a Now "staging" URL, E2E re-run against
  that staging URL, and (only on a version-tagged commit) promotion of that
  staging deploy to the production alias `jarl.downplay.co`, plus npm package
  publish.
- There was no separate persistent "staging" environment — every `master`
  build got its own ephemeral Now deployment URL, tested, then optionally
  aliased to production.

## What's carried forward vs. explicitly deferred

Carried forward into `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (ticket 60):

- checkout, Node setup, install, build, unit tests as an always-on job.
- an e2e job invoking a conventional `npm run test:e2e` script (the actual
  Playwright suite is being ported by ticket 57 in parallel; this job is
  `continue-on-error` for now, see the workflow comments).

Explicitly **not** re-implemented yet (left as placeholders/comments in the
new workflow, or simply dropped as no-longer-relevant):

- **Deployment** — the target service is undecided (probably AWS, as a
  subdomain of the randomdev business site; see ticket 58 for the site build
  and ticket 60/50 for the decision). The workflow has a clearly-marked
  placeholder job for this.
- **Now (Zeit) itself** — the service jarl.downplay.co was aliased to is
  being retired outright, not replaced 1:1.
- **Docker Hub publish of the demo site image** — superseded by whatever the
  new deploy target turns out to be; not carried forward.
- **npm package publish on tagged builds** — out of scope for this ticket;
  can be re-added as its own workflow/job once the v2 package boundaries
  (tickets 51/52/54/55/56) have settled.
- **Discord build/deploy notifications** — cosmetic, not CI-critical; can be
  re-added later if wanted.
- **Cypress Dashboard recording** — Cypress itself is being replaced by
  Playwright (ticket 57); no direct equivalent set up yet.
- **Dependency caching** — GitHub Actions' own `actions/setup-node` cache
  (keyed on the lockfile) is the intended equivalent once ticket 51 settles
  the package manager/lockfile story; not hand-rolled in this pass.

## Why the new workflow is expected to fail for a while

The new GitHub Actions workflow calls the *conventional* v2 scripts
(`npm run build`, `npm test`, `npm run test:e2e`) that several sibling
tickets are introducing in parallel (51 tooling, 52 TypeScript conversion,
54 atoms core, 55 bindings, 57 Playwright e2e). Until those land on `master`,
those scripts may not exist yet or may fail — that's expected and by design,
not a regression to fix here. **No branch-protection required check should
be added for this workflow yet** (that's a repository setting, out of scope
for this PR anyway) — turning the whole pipeline green is the milestone that
marks the v2 rewrite as substantially complete.
