## Why another router?

A web router simply performs a mapping between URL and state. I wanted something that did this
job extremely well without getting in the way of application structure and without mixing
routing logic up with the component tree. JARL builds that mapping out of composable
[jotai](https://jotai.org/) atoms: each route is its own atom, matching a piece of the URL and
telling you both whether it currently matches and how to build a URL back out of param values.
Routing decisions in your application are then just React state reads via hooks. (There's no
`<Switch/>` component either - a `<Route>` per page, or a plain conditional, does the job.)

Because each route atom is an independent, subscribable unit of jotai state, a component that
reads one only re-renders when *that atom's* derived value actually changes - not on every
navigation everywhere in the tree, which is where the "atomic" in "Atomic Routing Library"
comes from.

## Features

*   Composable route atoms - build nested/dynamic routes out of small, independent pieces
*   Framework-agnostic core (`jarl-atoms`) with thin, hooks-first React bindings (`jarl-react`)
*   Full querystring matching support
*   Resolve promises during routing (via jotai's own async atoms) and redirect if required
*   SSR/SSG-safe: the shared location atom is seedable per-render on the server
*   And much more...

## Concrete Example

Add to your project:

```
npm install jarl-atoms jarl-react
```

Declare some route atoms:

```ts
// routes.ts
import { rootAtom, staticRouteAtom, paramRouteAtom } from "jarl-atoms";

export const homeRoute = rootAtom;
export const aboutRoute = staticRouteAtom("about");
export const productsRoute = staticRouteAtom("products");
// The `productId` segment is bound into `values` when this route matches:
export const productRoute = paramRouteAtom("productId", { parent: productsRoute });
```

Wrap your app in a jotai `<Provider>` (this is what makes the shared location atom live) and
render based on which route atom currently matches, using `<Route>`:

```tsx
// main.tsx
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import { Provider } from "jotai";
import App from "./App";

createRoot(document.getElementById("root")!).render(
    <Provider>
        <App />
    </Provider>
);
```

```tsx
// App.tsx
import { Route } from "jarl-react";
import { homeRoute, aboutRoute, productRoute } from "./routes";

const App = () => (
    <>
        <Route on={homeRoute} exact>
            <HomePage />
        </Route>
        <Route on={aboutRoute} exact>
            <AboutPage />
        </Route>
        <Route on={productRoute} exact>
            {({ productId }) => <ProductPage productId={productId} />}
        </Route>
    </>
);

export default App;
```

Wait, we missed something! How do you actually link to a page? JARL has a `Link` component much
like other router libraries, but its unique feature is that it links directly to a route atom
plus param values, generating the URL by reversing that same atom:

```tsx
import { Link } from "jarl-react";

const MainMenu = () => (
    <nav>
        <Link route={homeRoute} to={{}} exact>Home</Link>
        <Link route={aboutRoute} to={{}}>About</Link>
        <Link route={productRoute} to={{ productId: "123" }}>
            Our Best Product Ever!
        </Link>
        <SearchForm />
    </nav>
);
```

These links use each route atom's `reverse()` to stringify the correct URL, e.g. the product
link becomes `<a href="/products/123">`.

A component that needs to navigate programmatically (rather than render a plain link) can use
the `useNavigate` hook instead:

```tsx
import { useState } from "react";
import { useNavigate } from "jarl-react";
import { queryParamAtom } from "jarl-atoms";

// A single named query-string param is its own composable route atom too:
const searchQueryRoute = queryParamAtom("q");

const SearchForm = () => {
    const [searchText, setSearchText] = useState("");
    const navigate = useNavigate(searchQueryRoute);
    return (
        <form onSubmit={(e) => { e.preventDefault(); navigate({ q: searchText }); }}>
            <input
                type="text"
                value={searchText}
                onChange={(e) => setSearchText(e.target.value)}
                placeholder="Enter search term"
            />
            <button type="submit">Search</button>
        </form>
    );
};

export default SearchForm;
```

That's all the basics! Hopefully this gave a flavour of the power and simplicity of this
routing system. See the [docs site](https://jarl.downplay.co) for query strings, redirects, and
data loading (resolving promises as part of a route match, `jarl-atoms`' `resolvedAtom`) in more
depth.

Built on [jotai](https://jotai.org/) atoms and `jotai-location` for the underlying,
SSR-safe browser history binding.
