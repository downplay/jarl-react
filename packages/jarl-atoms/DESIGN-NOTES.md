# Design notes

This file preserves the intent behind exploratory sketches that were originally
left as commented-out code in `src/routeAtom.ts` on the first (uncommitted)
draft of the v2 atoms core. They were lifted out here — rather than deleted —
so the alternative designs they were exploring aren't lost, in case a later
ticket (atom coverage gaps, React bindings, etc.) wants to revisit them.

## Tuple-shaped `RouteReturn`

```ts
// | [match: false, values: undefined, reverse: (values: T) => string]
// | [match: true, values: T, reverse: (values: T) => string];
```

An alternative to the object-shaped `RouteReturn` that shipped
(`{ match, values, exact, rest, reverse }`). A tuple would be more compact to
destructure (`const [match, values, reverse] = get(routeAtom)`), at the cost
of losing property names at call sites and making it harder to add fields
later (e.g. `exact`/`rest`) without a breaking positional change. The object
shape was kept for extensibility; worth revisiting only if ergonomics become
a real complaint.

## Alternate generic type extraction (`Extract<T, RoutePath>`)

```ts
// type Extract<T, RoutePath extends Path = Path> = T extends DefaultParams
//   ? T
//   : ExtractRouteParams<RoutePath>;
```

Sketch of a helper that would let `routeAtom` infer its param type either
from an explicit generic `T` or, if omitted, from parsing the pattern string
itself via `ExtractRouteParams<RoutePath>` (a template-literal-type param
extractor already defined earlier in the file but never wired up to
`routeAtom`, which instead takes explicit `matchPath`/`makePath` functions).
Wiring `ExtractRouteParams` up to infer types straight from a path-pattern
string, rather than requiring callers to hand-write `matchPath`/`makePath`,
is a reasonable follow-up if a string-pattern route helper is wanted (e.g.
`routeAtom<'/users/:id'>(...)` inferring `{ id: string }` automatically).

## Pattern-string-driven `routeAtom` overload

```ts
// export const routeAtom = <
//   T extends DefaultParams | undefined = undefined,
//   RoutePath extends Path = Path
// >(
//   pattern: RoutePath
// ): WritableAtom<RouteReturn<Extract<T>>, Extract<T>> => {
//   const reverse = (values: Extract<T>) => pattern;
//   return atom(
//     (get) => {
//       const location = get(locationAtom);
//       // TODO: Magic here with pieces of Jarl
//       const match = location.pathname === pattern;
//       const values = {} as unknown as Extract<T>;
//       return match ? [match, values, reverse] : [match, undefined, reverse];
//     },
//     (get, set, action) => {
//       set(locationAtom, { pathname: reverse(action) });
//     }
//   );
// };
```

An earlier, simpler `routeAtom` sketch that took a single pattern string
(e.g. `"/users/:id"`) and matched the *whole* location pathname against it in
one atom, rather than the path-segment-by-segment composition the shipped
`routeAtom`/`staticRouteAtom`/`paramRouteAtom` use (each route atom consumes
one segment off its parent's remaining path via `rest.path`). The segment
composition model won out because it supports nesting route atoms as parents
of other route atoms (see `RouteOptions.parent`), which a single
whole-pathname match can't do without re-parsing the full pattern at every
level. This sketch also used the tuple `RouteReturn` shape above and never
got its `matchPath`/`values` extraction implemented (`values = {} as
unknown as Extract<T>` was a stub) — both would need finishing if this
approach were revived instead of the segment-composition one.

## Alternate return type annotation

```ts
// : Match<T extends DefaultParams ? T : ExtractRouteParams<RoutePath>>;
```

A leftover return-type annotation for the pattern-string `routeAtom` sketch
above, referencing a `Match<T>` type that was never defined in this file.
Dead in isolation; only relevant if the pattern-string sketch is revived.
