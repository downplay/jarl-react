// Redirect support for the v2 atomic model, covering what v1 did with its
// `Redirect` / `redirect()` (removed with the rest of the v1 implementation;
// see the docs site's v1 History page), exercised by the 04Redirects suite:
// a route whose `state` is a Redirect gets followed immediately on match
// (no click required), and a `resolve` function can likewise return a
// Redirect to defer the decision until after async data has loaded.
//
// v1 does this as a side effect inside RoutingProvider.doNavigation, which
// both matches a route AND performs the navigation as one imperative step.
// Atoms split that in two, on purpose:
//   - redirectAtom: a *pure* RouteAtom-shaped leaf - reading it just tells
//     you whether the redirect route currently matches, exactly like any
//     other route. No side effects happen just from reading it.
//   - followRedirects: the actual effect - given a jotai store and one or
//     more redirectAtoms, subscribes to them and performs the
//     history.replace-style navigation the moment one starts matching.
// This keeps the "does this match" question composable/pure (usable in
// Route/Link like any other RouteAtom) while isolating the "and now actually
// navigate" side effect into an explicit, separately-testable primitive that
// a host environment (e.g. the React bindings package) wires up once at the
// root - analogous to jotai-location's own onMount subscription, just
// exposed as a reusable function instead of hidden inside an atom.
