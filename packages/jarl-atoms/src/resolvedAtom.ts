// Per-route async data loading, covering v1's `resolve`/`resolved`/
// `mapResolved` (RoutingProvider.js `doNavigation`'s Promise-chain reduction,
// routing.js's `mapResolvedToProps`), used by the advanced-routing gallery
// demo to fetch gallery item data once a route matches.
//
// v1 had to hand-build all of this: a reducer chain to run resolvers in
// series, a `resolved` object threaded through context, `mapResolvedToProps`
// to pick specific props out of it, and special-casing so a resolver
// returning a Redirect aborts the chain (RoutingProvider.js:255-270).
//
// None of that state machine needs porting: it's exactly what jotai's async
// atoms already give you. `resolvedAtom` below is a plain
// `atom(async (get) => ...)` - reading it through `get()` inside another
// async atom's body automatically awaits it and dedupes/caches via jotai's
// own dependency graph, which is the "run resolvers in series, only once"
// behaviour v1 built by hand. "mapResolved" likewise doesn't need its own
// primitive: it's just `atom(async (get) => mapFn(await get(resolvedAtom)))`
// - ordinary jotai derivation, so it's deliberately not reimplemented here.
// A resolver returning a Redirect (see redirectAtom.ts) is exposed as-is on
// the resolved value; `followResolvedRedirects` is the effect that turns
// that into an actual navigation, mirroring `followRedirects` for
// redirectAtom.
